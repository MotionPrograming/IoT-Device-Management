# 🌐 Blockchain-Based IoT Device Management

⚙️ **Project Status:** Active Development

👨‍💻 **Developer:** MotionProgramming

🎯 **Architecture:** Go Backend + Blockchain + IoT Device Integration

---

## 📋 Project Overview

**Blockchain-Based IoT Device Management** is an enterprise-grade platform designed to provide **secure device identity, authentication, and communication** across IoT networks. Using blockchain technology, each IoT device is assigned a **tamper-proof digital identity**, enabling trusted device-to-device interactions, automated smart contracts, and secure telemetry data exchange.

The system prioritizes a **security-first, scalable architecture**, leveraging Go’s concurrency features for high-throughput IoT deployments. Blockchain immutability combined with smart contracts ensures **prevention of device spoofing, unauthorized access, and data tampering**.
