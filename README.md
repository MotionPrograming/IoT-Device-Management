# üåê Blockchain-Based IoT Device Management System (BIoT-DM)

‚öôÔ∏è **Project Status:** Active Development
üë®‚Äçüíª **Developer:** MotionProgramming
üéØ **Architecture:** Pure Go Backend + Private Blockchain + MQTT + SQL Database Only

## üìã Project Overview

The **Blockchain-Based IoT Device Management System (BIoT-DM)** is a **secure, scalable, and high-performance platform** designed to manage **thousands of IoT devices in real-time**. Each device receives a **tamper-proof blockchain identity**, enabling **trusted peer-to-peer interactions, automated smart contracts, and secure telemetry data exchange**.

The system leverages **Go's lightweight concurrency model**, **private blockchain immutability**, **MQTT real-time messaging**, and **SQL database optimization**, ensuring **low latency, high throughput, and robust reliability** even under heavy IoT workloads.

### **SQL-Focused Optimization Highlights:**

* Advanced PostgreSQL time-series partitioning for telemetry data
* SQL-based caching with materialized views and triggers
* Database connection pooling and prepared statements
* JSON/JSONB columns for flexible device metadata storage
* SQL window functions for real-time analytics
* Database-level pub/sub for real-time notifications

---
