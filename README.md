# 🌐 Blockchain-Based IoT Device Management System (BIoT-DM)

⚙️ **Project Status:** Active Development

👨‍💻 **Developer:** Md Abdullah Rajeeb (MotionProgramming)

🎯 **Architecture:** pure Go Backend + Private Blockchain + Modern Frontend + Standard SQL

---

## 📋  Project Overview

**BIoT-DM** is a **high-performance IoT management platform** that combines blockchain technology with **portable SQL databases** (MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite). It ensures **security, trust, and scalability** across tens of thousands of IoT devices without relying on non-standard database engines.

The system addresses major IoT challenges:

* **Device identity spoofing** → blockchain-backed identities
* **Unauthorized access & tampering** → TLS/mTLS encryption + blockchain verification
* **Data integrity & auditability** → SQL-backed telemetry + immutable blockchain hashes

Key improvements for performance:

* **Batch telemetry writes** to SQL for high-frequency devices
* **Time-based partitioning** for telemetry and alert tables
* **In-memory caching inside Go backend** (lightweight maps) for frequently accessed metadata
* **Async blockchain anchoring** for non-critical telemetry
* **Optimized Go goroutines & worker pools** for concurrent devices

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 🔒 Security & Trust

* Blockchain-backed **device identity verification**
* End-to-end TLS/mTLS encryption
* Immutable **audit trails** anchored to blockchain + SQL logs
* Role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer)

### ⚡ Performance & Scalability

* Support **50,000+ devices** concurrently
* High-frequency telemetry ingestion with **goroutines & worker pools**
* Sub-second response for device commands
* SQL optimization via **batch inserts, indexing, and partitioning**

### 🤖 Device Management

* Secure device onboarding with blockchain keys
* Real-time telemetry tracking & anomaly detection
* Remote commands with execution tracking
* Efficient firmware validation and distribution
